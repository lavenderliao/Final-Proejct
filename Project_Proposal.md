# Final Project Proposal

## Team member: Anna Zhang and Peiyu Liao

## The Big Idea 


For our final project, we are looking to create a website that would analyze IMDB movies. When an user inputs a movie into the website, the website will return wether the movie is recommended, offer the user with 10 most recent movie reviews, and includes the word and text analysis for these 10 reviews including analysis such as similarity between these tweets, words with the most frequency, and sensitivity. This project aims to explore text analysis in great depth while at the same time offers the opportunity to practice website building. Our minimum viable product will be a plain website that holds all required functions to allow users to view basic text analysis results of the IMDB movie reviews after inputing a movie name. Our stretch goal would be to also offer the function that would recommend users with similar movies according to their movie choices.

## Learning Goals
### Shared Goals

As a team, our mean learning goal is to familiar ourselves with all the text analysis methods learned in class, while also conducting more research that would take our text analysis knowledge further. The mean reason why we chose to do the final project focusing on text anlaysis is because we have realized the importance of media in modern days. Media has become the primary source of information; thus, understanding and be able to conduct text analysis of media reviews in the future will help us to be more knowledgable of the information we receive.

### Individual Goals

Anna: my individual learning goal is to use this oppportunity to understand the common themes and trends of customer movie preferences based on their searches. Movies have many genres and can be of different ratings. Ratings help people save time by viewing good movies. Because I am a movie lover, I am interested in learning about trends and how movie reviews can be analyzed.

Peiyu: my individual learning goals are to improve my coding skill, expand my knowledge in coding, and learn to apply what I learned in this class into a real-world project that might solve the problem I would encounter in my future career. I am interested in marketing, so using python to analyze media and movies would be something really practical for me in the future.

## Implementation Plan

We envision that we are going to use IMDB library (IMDbPY) to build our project. We are going to figure out what other libraries we will use when we make specific step-by-step plan for coding.

## Project schedule 

1. 11/10 Project Proposal
2. Design Review - After Design Review, Refine Project direction and start working on code
3. Code Review - Refine code and keep working on code
4. Mid-Project Presentation - Keep working and make sure everything works
5. 12/06 Code Submission

## Collaboration plan

We plan to first split tasks up, try to complete them independently and then integrate. We have conducted similar method of team work whenw working on assignment 3. However, during assignment 3 we all encountered problems while working individually. So for the final project, we will ensure to help each other at any time even though we split up some work. We will use the agile development methothology because we think that this method will help us to debug more easily, as it allow us to develop the software in mini-increments. We expect the final project to consist of many complex steps. Therefore, an agile methology will help us to keep track of the steps and problems in a timely manner. 

We will go through following steps in agile development:
1. Careful analysis of requirements for this project and set our expectations
2. Make plan and divide tasks based on what we expect to do
3. Write code and test code until it runs smoothly, help each other whenever needed
4. Finish our tasks and give feedback to each other, then ask for feedback from other users
5. Compare our project with the key metrics in the instruction to make sure we meet all the requirements

## Risks

A big risk would be not able to connect to the IMDB data packages and other required sources appropriately. During assignment 3, because of connection issues we have encountered multiple instances not not being able to run the code sucessfully. Therefore for this project, we should be very careful in choosing the sources and the packages we use. It is also really difficult to debug with the same eyes. We encountered problems before that both of us got stuck and cannot realize that we only need a simple change to adjust the bug. Thus we should always make sure to ask each other for help whenever we are not sure of the problem, and also ask professor for help when in need. 

## Additional Course Content

We believe it would be great to learn how can we separate movies into genres based on their IMDB data.
