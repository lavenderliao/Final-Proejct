# Final Project Proposal

## Team member: Anna Zhang and Peiyu Liao

## The Big Idea 
What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?

## Learning Goals
### Shared Goals
1. 
### Individual Goals
1. 

## Implementation Plan
this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.

## Project schedule 

1. 11/10 Project Proposal
2. Design Review - After Design Review, Refine Project direction and start working on code
3. Code Review - Refine code and keep working on code
4. Mid-Project Presentation - Keep working and make sure everything works
5. 12/06 Code Submission

## Collaboration plan
How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.

We plan to split tasks up, complete them independently and then integrate. Through working together on Assignment 3, we think this is the way that works for us. 

## Risks
What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?

1. It is really difficult to debug with the same eyes. We encountered problems before that both of us got stuck and cannot realize that we only need a simple change to adjust the bug.

## Additional Course Content
What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?
