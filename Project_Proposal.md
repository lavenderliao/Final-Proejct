# Final Project Proposal

## Team member: Anna Zhang and Peiyu Liao

## The Big Idea 
We plan to create a website page that allows users to enter a word, and in return get ten most recent posts and the text analysis results on these posts. Our minimum viable product is ... Our stretch goal is ....

For our final project, we are looking to create a website that would analyze twitter tweets. When an user inputs a word into the website, the website will return the user with 10 most recent Twitter tweets that includes the word and text analysis for these 10 tweets, including analysis such as similarity between these tweets, words with the most frequency, and sensitivity. This project aims to explore text analysis in great depth while at the same time offers the opportunity to practice website building. Our minimum viable product will be a plain website that holds all required functions to allow users to view basic text analysis results of Twitter tweets after inputing a word. Our stretch goal would be to also offer the function that would recommend users with similar articles from news souces that match the key words in Twitter tweets.

## Learning Goals
### Shared Goals
1. As a team, our mean learning goal is to familiar ourselves with all the text analysis methods learned in class, while also conducting more research that would take our text analysis knowledge further. The mean reason why we chose to do the final project focusing on text anlaysis is because we have realized the importance of media in modern days. Media has become the primary source of information; thus, understanding and be able to conduct text analysis of documents in the future will help us to be more knowledgable of the information we receive.

### Individual Goals
1. 
Anna: my individual learning goals is to use this oppportunity to understand the common themes and trends of Twitter tweets based on key words. Unlike other forms of information such as the news, websites, and books, Twitter tweets tend to be more free and opinionated. Because I use Twitter quite often to obtain information of the topics I am interested in, I think this project would provide me insights into some of the unique characteristics of Twitter tweets.

Peiyu:

## Implementation Plan
this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.

Library: Tweety, Flask

## Project schedule 

1. 11/10 Project Proposal
2. Design Review - After Design Review, Refine Project direction and start working on code
3. Code Review - Refine code and keep working on code
4. Mid-Project Presentation - Keep working and make sure everything works
5. 12/06 Code Submission

## Collaboration plan
How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.

We plan to first split tasks up, try to complete them independently and then integrate. We have conducted similar method of team work whenw working on assignment 3. However, during assignment 3 we all encountered problems while working individually. So for the final project, we will ensure to help each other at any time even though we split up some work. We will use the agile development methothology because we think that this method will help us to debug more easily, as it allow us to develop the software in mini-increments. We expect the final project to consist of many complex steps. Therefore, an agile methology will help us to keep track of the steps and problems in a timely manner. 

## Risks
What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?

A big risk would be not able to connet to the Twitter tweets and other required sources appropriately. During assignment 3, because of connection issues we have encountered multiple instances not not being able to run the code sucessfully. Therefore for this project, we should be very careful in choosing the sources and the packages we use. It is also really difficult to debug with the same eyes. We encountered problems before that both of us got stuck and cannot realize that we only need a simple change to adjust the bug. Thus we should always make sure to ask each other for help whenever we are not sure of the problem, and also ask professor for help when in need. 

## Additional Course Content
What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?

I think it would be great to cover ways of locating the words entered by the user to hashtages on Twitter, because people meaningly expect the searches on Twitter to be based on hashtages, which direct them to the topics they are interested in.
