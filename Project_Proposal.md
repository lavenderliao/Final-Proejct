# Final Project Proposal

## Team member: Anna Zhang and Peiyu Liao

## The Big Idea 
We plan to create a website page that allows users to enter a word, and in return get ten most recent posts and the text analysis results on these posts. Our minimum viable product is that our website runs smoothly. Our stretch goal is self-learning from https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/03/02/mining-twitter-data-with-python-part-1/ and adding additional features to our basic program.

## Implementation Plan

We envision that we are going to use tweety and Flask library to build our project. We are going to figure out what other libraries we will use when we make specific step-by-step plan for coding.

## Project schedule 

1. 11/10 Project Proposal
2. Design Review - After Design Review, Refine Project direction and start working on code
3. Code Review - Refine code and keep working on code
4. Mid-Project Presentation - Keep working and make sure everything works
5. 12/06 Code Submission

## Collaboration plan

We plan to split tasks up, complete them independently and then integrate. Through working together on Assignment 3, we think this is the way that works for us. We will try to implement agile development during this project. We will go through following steps in agile development:
1. Careful analysis of requirements for this project and set our expectations
2. Make plan and divide tasks based on what we expect to do
3. Write code and test code until it runs smoothly, help each other whenever needed
4. Finish our tasks and give feedback to each other, then ask for feedback from other users
5. Compare our project with the key metrics in the instruction to make sure we meet all the requirements

## Risks
What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?

1. It is really difficult to debug with the same eyes. We encountered problems before that both of us got stuck and cannot realize that we only need a simple change to adjust the bug.

## Additional Course Content
What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?
We could not think of anything for now.
