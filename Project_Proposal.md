# Final Project Proposal

## Team member: Anna Zhang and Peiyu Liao

## The Big Idea 


For our final project, we are looking to create a website that would analyze twitter tweets. When an user inputs a word into the website, the website will return the user with 10 most recent Twitter tweets that includes the word and text analysis for these 10 tweets, including analysis such as similarity between these tweets, words with the most frequency, and sensitivity. This project aims to explore text analysis in great depth while at the same time offers the opportunity to practice website building. Our minimum viable product will be a plain website that holds all required functions to allow users to view basic text analysis results of Twitter tweets after inputing a word. Our stretch goal would be to also offer the function that would recommend users with similar articles from news sources that match the key words in Twitter tweets, as well as adding additional features by self-learning from https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/03/02/mining-twitter-data-with-python-part-1/.

## Learning Goals
### Shared Goals

As a team, our mean learning goal is to familiar ourselves with all the text analysis methods learned in class, while also conducting more research that would take our text analysis knowledge further. The mean reason why we chose to do the final project focusing on text anlaysis is because we have realized the importance of media in modern days. Media has become the primary source of information; thus, understanding and be able to conduct text analysis of documents in the future will help us to be more knowledgable of the information we receive.

### Individual Goals

Anna: my individual learning goal is to use this oppportunity to understand the common themes and trends of Twitter tweets based on key words. Unlike other forms of information such as the news, websites, and books, Twitter tweets tend to be more free and opinionated. Because I use Twitter quite often to obtain information of the topics I am interested in, I think this project would provide me insights into some of the unique characteristics of Twitter tweets.

Peiyu: my individual learning goals are to improve my coding skill, expand my knowledge in coding, and learn to apply what I learned in this class into a real-world project that might solve the problem I would encounter in my future career. I am interested in marketing, so using python to analyze social media would be something really practical for me in the future.

## Implementation Plan

We envision that we are going to use tweety and Flask library to build our project. We are going to figure out what other libraries we will use when we make specific step-by-step plan for coding.

## Project schedule 

1. 11/10 Project Proposal
2. Design Review - After Design Review, Refine Project direction and start working on code
3. Code Review - Refine code and keep working on code
4. Mid-Project Presentation - Keep working and make sure everything works
5. 12/06 Code Submission

## Collaboration plan

We plan to first split tasks up, try to complete them independently and then integrate. We have conducted similar method of team work whenw working on assignment 3. However, during assignment 3 we all encountered problems while working individually. So for the final project, we will ensure to help each other at any time even though we split up some work. We will use the agile development methothology because we think that this method will help us to debug more easily, as it allow us to develop the software in mini-increments. We expect the final project to consist of many complex steps. Therefore, an agile methology will help us to keep track of the steps and problems in a timely manner. 

We will go through following steps in agile development:
1. Careful analysis of requirements for this project and set our expectations
2. Make plan and divide tasks based on what we expect to do
3. Write code and test code until it runs smoothly, help each other whenever needed
4. Finish our tasks and give feedback to each other, then ask for feedback from other users
5. Compare our project with the key metrics in the instruction to make sure we meet all the requirements

## Risks

A big risk would be not able to connet to the Twitter tweets and other required sources appropriately. During assignment 3, because of connection issues we have encountered multiple instances not not being able to run the code sucessfully. Therefore for this project, we should be very careful in choosing the sources and the packages we use. It is also really difficult to debug with the same eyes. We encountered problems before that both of us got stuck and cannot realize that we only need a simple change to adjust the bug. Thus we should always make sure to ask each other for help whenever we are not sure of the problem, and also ask professor for help when in need. 

## Additional Course Content

I think it would be great to cover ways of locating the words entered by the user to hashtages on Twitter, because people meaningly expect the searches on Twitter to be based on hashtages, which direct them to the topics they are interested in.
